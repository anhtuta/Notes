My name is Tu, I'm 26 years old and currently I'm living in Hanoi. My home is about 12 kilometers from here. I've attended HUST since 2013 where I've majored in Electronics and Telecommunication. After I graduated from university in 2018, I've got Samsung scholarship and I have been working at Samsung R&D center since then.
