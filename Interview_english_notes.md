I've got a little trouble to find the location of this building, and in additional, I've got stuck in some traffic, so it took more time to get here than I expected. But luckily, I left home early this morning, so I still managed to arrive on time

## 1. Tell me about yourself
- Name, age, address, how far from year
- University, major
- First job at Samsung R&D, duties
- Hobbies (in free time)

**My name is** Tu, I'm 26 years old and currently I'm living in Hanoi. My home is about 12 kilometers from here. I've **attended** HUST since 2013 and **my major was** (where I've **majored in**) Electronics and Telecommunication. After I graduated from university in 2018, I've got Samsung scholarship and I **have been working** at Samsung R&D center since then. My duties include **developing backend servers, reviewing source codes and assiting other team members**. In my free time, I usually watch movies, listen to music, reading book, manga or just hang out with some of my friends.

### Why did you study Electronics instead of IT?
Well, to be honest, the first year at university, my grade wasn't high enough for me to get into IT major, so I have to picked Electronics instead!

## 2. Hobbies
I love comic books, but I don't have much free time everyday so currently, I only read One Piece and Conan Detective. I haven't read some latest chapters yet, because I'm the type of person who don't want to wait so long for the next chapter or volume **to be released**. So I'll wait until lots of chapters come out and read them all.

### Your favorite manga
It is **One Piece** of course! One Piece is the manga I love the most because it could give me **variety of emotions**: sad, happy, angry, nervous. It could make me cry and smile at the same time

### Your favorite charater in One Piece
It's hard to determine who is the one I love the most. Every charater, both **protagonists** and **antagonists** have their own **personality**, for example:
- Luffy, the main protagonist of the manga, the caption of the Straw hat pirates, is a righteous, confident, strong-willed person but also sometimes being foolish, stubborn and reckless. His **lifelong dream** is to **become the Pirate king**
- Sanji is a kind, calm and cool person and a wonderful chef. His **ultimate goal** is to **discover All Blue**, the part of the ocean where **all four seas happen to meet**.
- Zoro, the one who wants to become the **world's greatest swordsman**, always looks so serious and detests Sanji a lot!

I like all of them, if I have to pick the most favorite charater, maybe it would be Admiral Kuzan (His code name is Blue Pheasant in English). I'd like to become him because I'm interested in the devil fruit he ate: it's Chilly-Chilly Fruit. If I've got his power, I would make it snow all the time during the winter

### Your favorite story in One Piece
The story touched me the most is Enies Lobby, when Luffy and his crew tried to save Nico Robin (one of his members) from Marines. At that time, Robin **sacrificed her life** to protect all of her friends from **being attack by Marines Admirals**. But Luffy didn't want to lose any of his member, so he decided to **strike** first by directly **invaded the Tower of Justice** (that tower is the world government's stronghold). He told Robin that: *"Say you want to live, we are friends"*. Robin replied while crying "Yes". And then the battle with CP9 (a secret Cipher Pol organization) happend there, was **the most memorable battle** to me

### Your favorite music genre /'ʒɑ:nrə/
I often listen to **pop music, electronic dance music and Vpop**. In pop music, **my favorite bands and singers** are One Direction, One Republic, Charlie Puth, Taylor Swift. About EDM, I'm **a big fan** of Alan Walker, who famous with single Faded, and TheFatRat, who well-known with Unity and Flyaway

### Your favorite book
I read several novels and the latest book I read is "Let Me Eat Your Pancreas". Basically, this novel is a story about a girl named Sakura, who was **suffering from a fatal pancreatic illess** and would die soon, and a boy name Haruki, who **accidentally knew Sakura's illness condition**. They became friends and spent time with one another for the rest her life. Both of them had a lot of fun during that time. After Sakura died, Haruki broke down into tears. That is an sad ending story!

### Do you like football?
Well, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of football, it's **relatively opposite to** the most men, isn't it? But I do know the two most famous football players in the world, they are Cristiano Ronaldo, who is playing for Juventus and the other is Lionel Messi who is playing for Barcelona.

### Which one do you think is better, Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi?
Well, I don't know exactly who is better because I don't spend a lot of time watching them play on TV. In my opinion, each player has their own strength. Ronaldo is taller than Messi so I think he **could be superior in** header skill. On the contrary, Messi the left-footed man, is shorter than Ronaldo so I think he **could be able to perform** dribble skill better than Rolando

## 3. What are your strengths?
I believe my strongest trait is **working hard** in order to **finish my work before deadline**. I'm the type of person who don't like **working overtime**, especially at the weekend, so I always try to complete my work on time. You know, we should spend our weekend with my family and friends, or with someone we love!

## 4. What are your weaknesses?
I think my weakest is the ability to communicate using English, because I haven't have much opportunity to speak to someone in English. All I could do is using text messsages to chat with people who don't know Vietnamese. Sometimes it's hard for me to explain my idea **effectively** to my foreign customers or co-workers. I'm considering myself to take an English class in the near future, so my speaking skill will be better soon

## 5. Why are you leaving your job?
The main reason why I want to leave my current job is because I found my work boring and doesn't have much challenges to me. I want to find a new environment that is more interesting, more challenging and gives me a chance to learn more about new technologies.

## 6. What is your short-team goal?
About my short-team goal, I would like to improve English speaking skill in order to **communicate effectively** to customers and other people. If I have time, I'll consider myself to participate in an English class. In the near future, I also want to study and master some technologies that are related to my work

## 7. What is your long-term goal?
Well, I don't have a detailed plan but the most important thing is that I want to become a techical lead in software engineering. Nowadays, technologies are changing day to day, so I have to study more and of course learn from my co-workers, especially the seniors, to fulfill my objectives

## 8. If you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be and why?
If I could change one thing about myself, maybe it could be to become less introvert. I'm a quite person and sometimes don't want to spend lots of time talking with someone unless it's related to work. I would like to change that so I could be able to make more friends

## 9. Which category do you fall under? A person who anticipates a problem well, or a person who reacts to a problem well?
I think I'm the type of person who reacting to a problem is better than anticipating it. When I'm faced with a problem, I know what steps to take to deal with it

## 10. Which category do you fall under? A person who anticipates a problem well, or a person who reacts to a problem well?
I think I'm the type of person who reacting to a problem is better than anticipating it. When I'm faced with a problem, I know what steps to take to deal with it
