## 1. Tell me about yourself
My name is Tu, I'm 26 years old and currently I'm living in Hanoi. My home is about 12 kilometers from here. I've attended HUST since 2013 where I've **majored in** Electronics and Telecommunication. After I graduated from university in 2018, I've got Samsung scholarship and I **have been working** at Samsung R&D center since then. My duties include **developing backend servers, reviewing source codes and assiting other team members** In my free time, I usually watch movies, listen to music, reading book, manga or just hang out with some of my friends.

## 2. Hobbies
I love comic books, but I don't have much free time everyday so currently, I only read One Piece and Conan Detective. I haven't read some latest chapters yet, because I'm the type of person who don't want to wait so long for the next chapter or volume **to be released**. So I'll wait until lots of chapters come out and read them all.

### Your favorite manga
It is One Piece of course! One Piece is the manga I love the most because it could give me **variety of emotions**: sad, happy, angry, nervous. It could make me cry and smile at the same time

### Your favorite charater in One Piece
It's hard to determine who is the one I love the most. Every charater, both **protagonists** and **antagonists** have their own **personality**, for example:
- Luffy, the main protagonist of the manga, the caption of the Straw hat pirates, is a righteous, confident, strong-willed person but also sometimes being foolish, stubborn and reckless. His **lifelong dream** is to **become the Pirate king**
- Sanji is a kind, calm and cool person and a wonderful chef. His **ultimate goal** is to **discover All Blue**, the part of the ocean where **all four seas happen to meet**.
- Zoro, the one who wants to become the **world's greatest swordsman**, always looks so serious and detests Sanji a lot!

I like all of them, if I have to pick the most favorite charater, maybe it would be Admiral Kuzan (His code name is Blue Pheasant in English). I'd like to become him because I'm interested in the devil fruit he ate: it's Chilly-Chilly Fruit. If I've got his power, I would make it snow all the time during the winter

### Your favorite story in One Piece
The story touched me the most is Enies Lobby, when Luffy and his crew tried to save Nico Robin (one of his members) from Marines. At that time, Robin **sacrificed her life** to protect all of her friends from **being attack by Marines Admirals**. But Luffy didn't want to lose any of his member, so he decided to **strike** first, and directly **invaded the Tower of Justice** (a world government stronghold). He told Robin that: *"Say you want to live, we are friends"*. Robin replied while crying "Yes". And then the battle with CP9 (a secret Cipher Pol organization) happend there, was **the most memorable battle** to me

### Your favorite music genre /'ʒɑ:nrə/
I often listen to pop music, electronic dance music and Vpop. In pop music, my favorite bands and singers are One Direction, One Republic, Charlie Puth, Taylor Swift. About EDM, my favorite DJs are Alan Walker, who famous with single Faded, and TheFatRat, who well-known with Unity and Flyaway

### Your favorite book
I read several novels and the latest book I read is "Let Me Eat Your Pancreas". Basically, this novel is a story about a girl named Sakura, who was suffering from a fatal pancreatic illess and would die soon, and a boy name Haruki, who accidentally knew Sakura's illness condition. They became friends and spent time with one another for the rest her life. Both of them had a lot of fun during that time. After Sakura died, Haruki broke down into tears. That is an sad ending story!

## 3. What are your strengths?
I believe my strongest trait is **working hard** in order to **finish my work before deadline**. I'm the type of person who don't like **working overtime**, especially at the weekend, so I always try to complete my work on time. You know, we should spend our weekend with my family and friends, or with someone we love!

## 4. What are your weaknesses?
I think my weakest is the ability to communicate using English, because I don't have much opportunity in Samsung to speak to someone using English. All I could do is using text messsages to chat with people who don't know Vietnamese. Sometimes it's hard for me to explain my idea **effectively** to my foreign customers if I have to talk to them. I know that English skill is important in your company, so I'll try my best to improve it. I know that if I have a chance to work with your company, my English will be better!

## 5. Why are you leaving your job?
