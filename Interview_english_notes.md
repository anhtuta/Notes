## 1. Tell me about yourself
My name is Tu, I'm 26 years old and currently I'm living in Hanoi. My home is about 12 kilometers from here. I've attended HUST since 2013 where I've majored in Electronics and Telecommunication. After I graduated from university in 2018, I've got Samsung scholarship and I have been working at Samsung R&D center since then. In my free time, I usually watch movies, listen to music, reading book, manga or just hang out with some of my friends.

## 2. Hobbies
I love comic books, but I don't have much free time everyday so currently, I only read One Piece and Conan Detective. I haven't read some latest chapters yet, because I'm the type of person who don't want to wait so long for the next chapter or volume to be released. So I'll wait until lots of chapters come out and read them all.

### My favorite charater in One Piece
It's hard to determine who is the one I love the most. Every charater, both protagonists and antagonists have their own personality, for example:
- Luffy, the main protagonist of the manga, the caption of the Straw hat pirates, is a righteous, confident, strong-willed person but also sometimes being foolish stubborn and reckless. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate king
- Black Leg Sanji is a kind, calm and cool person and a wonderful chef. His ultimate goal is to discover All Blue, the part of the ocean where all four seas happen to meet.
- Zoro, the one who wants to become the world's greatest swordsman, always looks so serious and detests Sanji a lot!
I like all of them, if I have to pick the most favorite charater, maybe it would be Admiral Kuzan (His code name is Blue Pheasant in English). I'd like to become him because of the devil fruit he ate: its Chilly-Chilly Fruit. If I had his power, I would make it snow all the time during the winter

### My favorite story in One Piece
One Piece is the manga I love the most because it could give me diffirent levels of emotions: sad, happy, angry, nervous. It could make cry and smile. The story touched me the most is Enies Lobby, when Luffy and his crew tried to save Nico Robin (one of his members) from marine. At that time, Robin sacrificed her life to protect all of her friends from being attack by admirals. But Luffy didn't want to lose any of his member, so he decided to strike first, and directly invaded the Tower of Justice. He told Robin that: "Say you want to live, we are friends". Robin said "Yes". And then the battle with CP9 (a secret Cipher Pol organization) happend there, was the most memorable battle to me

### My favorite music genre /'ʒɑ:nrə/
I often listen to pop music, electronic dance music and Vpop. In pop music, my favorite bands and singers are One Direction, One Republic, Charlie Puth, Taylor Swift, Alan. About EDM, my favorite DJs are Alan Walker, who famous with single Faded, and TheFatRat, who well-known with Unity and Flyaway

### My favorite book
I read several light novels and the latest book I read is "Let Me Eat Your Pancreas". Basically, this novel is a story about a girl name Sakura, who was suffering from a fatal pancreatic illess and would die soon, and a boy name Haruki, who accidentally knew Sakura's illness condition. They became friends and spent time with one another for the rest her life. Both of them had a lot of fun during that time. After Sakura died, Haruki broke down into tears
