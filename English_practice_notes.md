## Describe weather in your region
Hanoi is my hometown. It is pretty typical for tropical monsoon climate with hot, rainy and long-lasting summer. Although locating in tropical are, but Hanoi isn't hot all the time of the year. It has 4 seasons with a cold Winter (even though it's not freezing like countries in temperate area) and that's the season I love the most.

Springtime in Hanoi runs from March to first days of April, characterized by humid and warm weather with frequent drizzles. This kind of weather is suitable for plants to grow and flowers to blossom. Peach-blossom is one of the most famous flowers in Spring in Hanoi in the occasion Tet holiday. Spring coming means lunar new year is comming, and we call it Tet holiday, it is the biggest and the most anticipated holiday in Vietnam.

The Summer starts from middle April and lasts to the end of August. It seems to be the hardest season for tourists to travel in Hanoi because of the heat. July usually is the hottest month of the year, with the temperature always over 30 degree, especially some days can reach to over 40 degree, but the humidity is often high, which makes us feel uncomfortable. At the end of these boiling days, it often ends up with a shower (a rain for a short period of time), along with thunderstorm, which becomes dangerous outside.

Autumn (or fall) is considered to be the most pleasant time in Hanoi. This season lasts from September to first days of November, and the climate is so cool, dry but still sunny. We can see many yellow and red leaf trees on the streets. It is the best time to go outdoors, enjoy the sunny weather without feeling hot, and go sightseeing with the goal of looking at beautiful autumn foliage.

The Winter runs from middle of December to February, with the temperature ususally below 20 degree, but sometimes it drops below 10 degree, along with low humidity. Winter ofter brings a sad feeling, because the sky is ofter dark and gloomy. I really enjoy this kind of cold weather because Hanoi is located in tropical area, so Winter is much more comfortable than the Summer.
